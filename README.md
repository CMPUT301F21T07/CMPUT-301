**Project Description**

You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the follow goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.

To assist in forming good habits, we want a mobile application that allows one to track, encourage, and share their habits. Recurring habits could be, for example, "write a joke", "eat breakfast", "exercise dog", "call family", and "no car accident". The intent is to make such habits: regular (e.g., daily), unbroken (so missed habit events are noted), and shared (so there's public pressure not to miss).

**Needs in (Partial) User Story Form**

*These descriptions may change to correct omissions and clarify noticed issues. Talk to the customer and propose options, rather than making what might be an unwarranted assumption or interpretation.
