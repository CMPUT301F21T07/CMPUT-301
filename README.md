# CMPUT-301

Project Part 1
---------------------------------
Instructions: Edit the team.txt file under doc folder and write new line (CCID and github username with space in between).


Project Part 1
---------------------------------
Product backlog
1. Use GitHub project to create a backlog. Here is an [example](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/projects/3) 
2. User stories need to be understood by following this template: As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >. You have to determine the reason. User/role and goal are given in the project description. Here is a nice [article](https://medium.com/nsquared-labs/user-stories-and-the-product-backlog-in-scrum-c87d36df4b96) about user stories, story points, risk, and complexity.
3. Prioritize your user stories so that you will have a working app (even though some features are yet to implement) at the halfway point.

UI mockup and storyboard
1. Use a tool (don't expect you to pay as most of them are super expensive) like bubble.io, mockflow. Here are more [info](https://blog.capterra.com/free-and-open-source-wireframe-tools/). Choose something that works best for you. Please, no doodles.
2. Storyboard should demonstrate a flow of interfaces depends on the activity that you perform.
3. Use a habit app in google playstore to get an idea. You may not have to implement all features that you see in it. But could be a good influence.

OO analysis
1. Here, you will understand the classes, their responsibilities, and their collaborators. [This](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm) might help.
2. Here is a free [tool](https://echeung.me/crcmaker/).
3. The idea is you will recognize model classes, control classes, and boundary classes so that you will generate a UML class diagram for project part III.

Tool use
When you use third-party tools to create UML diagrams, storyboards export them to a PNG, JPEG, or any other format and include them in your GitHub wiki pages. To navigate nicely, add a link to the wiki page from the readme page of the project.
